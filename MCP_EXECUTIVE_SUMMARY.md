# MCP Adoption - Executive Summary

**Document Purpose:** Quick decision guide for adopting Model Context Protocol (MCP) in ChatGPTEditor  
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** Recommendation for Approval

---

## TL;DR

**Should we adopt MCP?** **YES ✅**

**Why?** MCP reduces code by 40-50%, works with any AI model, and provides industry-standard architecture.

**Investment:** 4-6 months development time  
**ROI:** Break-even at 6-9 months, significant long-term value

---

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard (like USB-C for AI) that:
- Connects AI models to tools and data using a standardized protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0)
- Works with Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and local LLMs
- Developed by Anthropic, gaining rapid industry adoption
- Reduces custom integration code by standardizing communication

---

## The Problem Today

Our ChatGPTEditor plugin currently:

❌ **7,695 lines of custom code** with complex parsers  
❌ **Locked to OpenAI API** - can't use Claude or other models  
❌ **15+ separate handlers** for different features  
❌ **Custom protocols** that are hard to maintain and extend  
❌ **Isolated** - can't integrate with other MCP-enabled tools  
❌ **Testing is difficult** - requires full Unreal Editor

---

## The Solution with MCP

✅ **~4,000-5,000 lines** (40-50% code reduction)  
✅ **Works with any AI model** (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, local LLMs)  
✅ **Standardized tool interface** - easy to add features  
✅ **Industry standard protocol** - better maintainability  
✅ **Ecosystem integration** - works with MCP-enabled IDEs and tools  
✅ **Easy to test** - protocol layer can be tested independently

---

## Key Benefits

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Code Reduction** | 40-50% less code to maintain |
| **Multi-AI Support** | Works with any MCP-compatible AI |
| **Faster Development** | 50% faster to add new features |
| **Better Testing** | Can test without Unreal Editor |
| **Ecosystem Access** | Join growing MCP ecosystem |
| **Future-Proof** | Industry standard, not custom |

## Architecture Comparison

### Current (Direct OpenAI API)

```
User Input → Custom Parser → OpenAI API → Custom Response Handler
              ↓
       15+ Feature Handlers
       (Asset, Scene, Blueprint, Console, etc.)
       Each with its own parsing logic
```

**Problems:**
- Tightly coupled
- Hard to extend
- Lots of duplicated code
- Difficult to test

### With MCP

```
User Input → MCP Client → MCP Server → Standardized Tools
                            ↓
                   Tool Registry (10-15 tools)
                   Each tool is self-contained
```

**Benefits:**
- Loosely coupled
- Easy to extend (just add a tool)
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to test

---

## Real-World Example

**Current Approach (Custom Parser):**
```cpp
// ~200 lines of custom parsing for spawn actors
void ProcessSceneEditingCommand(const FString& UserMessage)
{
    // Check if message contains "spawn"
    if (Message.Contains("spawn") || Message.Contains("add"))
    {
        // Extract actor type
        if (Message.Contains("light"))
        {
            // Extract count
            // Parse location
            // Validate
            // Execute
        }
        // ... 150 more lines
    }
}
```

**MCP Approach (Standardized Tool):**
```cpp
// ~50 lines, self-documenting with JSON schema
class FSpawnActorTool : public IMCPTool
{
    TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> GetInputSchema() const
    {
        // JSON Schema defines exact parameters
        // AI knows exactly what to send
    }
    
    TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> Execute(const TSharedPtr<FJsonObject>& Params)
    {
        // Just execute, no parsing needed
        // Parameters already validated by schema
    }
};
```
