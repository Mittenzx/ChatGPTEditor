## Usage

### Basic Conversation

1. Type your message in the input box at the bottom
2. Click "Send" or press **Ctrl+Enter** to submit your message to ChatGPT
3. Responses will appear in the conversation history area
4. Click "Clear" or press **Ctrl+L** to start a new conversation

### Editor Asset Automation

The plugin can automatically detect and execute asset operations from ChatGPT responses. When enabled, you can use natural language to create and manage assets:

#### Supported Commands

**Creating Assets:**
- `Create material MyMaterial` - Creates a new material asset
- `Create texture MyTexture` - Creates a new texture asset
- `Create blueprint MyBlueprint` - Creates a new blueprint asset

**Managing Assets:**
- `Rename OldAssetName to NewAssetName` - Renames an existing asset
- `Delete MyAsset` - Deletes an asset (requires confirmation)

#### How It Works

1. **Enable Asset Write Permission**: Check the "Allow Asset Write Operations" checkbox
2. **Confirm the Warning**: Accept the security warning dialog
3. **Send Natural Language Commands**: Ask ChatGPT to create or modify assets
   - Example: "Create a material called M_GlowingMetal"
4. **Review the Preview**: A confirmation dialog shows what will be created/modified
5. **Confirm or Cancel**: Choose whether to proceed with the operation
6. **Check Results**: The operation is logged and feedback appears in the conversation

#### Security Features

- **Confirmation Required**: Every asset operation requires explicit user confirmation
- **Operation Preview**: See exactly what will happen before it executes
- **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged to `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log`
- **Permission Control**: Asset write must be explicitly enabled
- **Destructive Operation Warnings**: Extra warnings for delete and rename operations

#### Example Workflow

```
You: "Create a material called M_Metal and a texture called T_MetalBase"

ChatGPT: "I'll help you create those assets. Create material M_Metal. Create texture T_MetalBase."

System: Detected 2 asset operation(s) in response.
System: Processing: Create Material - M_Metal
[Confirmation Dialog Appears]
System: ‚úì Successfully executed: Create Material
System: Processing: Create Texture - T_MetalBase
[Confirmation Dialog Appears]
System: ‚úì Successfully executed: Create Texture
```

#### Audit Log

All asset operations are logged to `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log` with:
- Timestamp
- User name
- Operation type
- Asset name
- Success/failure status
- Additional details

Example log entry:
```
[2024-10-26 15:30:45] User: JohnDoe | Operation: Create Material | Asset: M_Metal | Success: YES | Details: Operation completed successfully
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The plugin supports several keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Ctrl+Enter** | Send message to ChatGPT |
| **Ctrl+L** | Clear conversation history |
| **Ctrl+Plus** (+) | Increase font size |
| **Ctrl+Minus** (-) | Decrease font size |
| **Ctrl+0** | Reset font size to default |

### Accessibility Features

#### Adjustable Font Size
- Use the **A-** button or **Ctrl+Minus** to decrease font size

- ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard shortcuts reference is always visible at the bottom

### Blueprint Scripting Assistant

The plugin includes a Blueprint Scripting Assistant feature that allows you to generate and explain Blueprint logic using natural language:

#### Generating Blueprints

1. **Enable Asset Write Permission**: The "Allow Asset Write Operations" toggle must be enabled to generate Blueprints
2. **Enter your prompt**: In the "Blueprint Scripting Assistant" section, describe the Blueprint logic you want to create
   - Example: "Create a health pickup that restores 25 health points when the player overlaps it"
3. **Click "Generate Blueprint"**: The system will send your request to ChatGPT
4. **Review the preview**: A preview dialog will show you:
   - Your original request
   - A description of the generated Blueprint
   - List of nodes that will be created
   - Connections between nodes
   - A security warning
5. **Approve or Reject**: 
   - Click "Approve & Create" to proceed with Blueprint creation
   - Click "Reject" to cancel the operation
6. **All actions are logged**: Every generation request, preview, and approval/rejection is recorded in the audit log

**Security Notes:**
- All Blueprint generation requires manual preview and approval
- No code is executed without your explicit confirmation
- Requires "Allow Asset Write Operations" permission to be enabled
- All operations are logged in the audit log

#### Explaining Blueprints

1. **Enter Blueprint name**: In the Blueprint name field, type the name of a Blueprint you want explained
2. **Click "Explain Blueprint"**: The system will request an explanation from ChatGPT
3. **View explanation**: The explanation will appear in the conversation history with:
   - A summary of the Blueprint's purpose
   - Step-by-step breakdown of its logic
4. **All explanations are logged**: Every explanation request is recorded in the audit log

**Note**: This feature provides AI-generated explanations based on the Blueprint name. For actual Blueprint analysis, the Blueprint would need to be selected in the editor (future enhancement).

#### Audit Log

The plugin maintains a comprehensive audit log of all Blueprint Scripting Assistant activities:

- **What's logged**:
  - All Blueprint generation requests
  - All Blueprint explanation requests
  - All preview dialogs shown
  - All user approvals and rejections
  - Timestamps for all operations

- **Exporting the log**:
  1. Click "Export Audit Log" in the Blueprint Scripting Assistant section
  2. Choose a location to save the log file
  3. The log will be exported as a text file with all recorded activities

- **Use cases**:
  - Security compliance and auditing
  - Tracking AI-assisted modifications
  - Debugging and troubleshooting
  - Team collaboration and review

### Security Permissions

The plugin includes three permission toggles that are **disabled by default** for your safety:

#### üîí Allow Asset Write Operations (DANGEROUS)
- **Default**: OFF
- **Risk**: Can modify or delete project assets
- **When to enable**: Required for Blueprint generation feature
- **Warning**: Always backup your project before enabling
- **Blueprint Assistant**: Must be enabled to generate Blueprints

#### üîí Allow Console Commands (DANGEROUS)
- **Default**: OFF
- **Risk**: Can execute arbitrary console commands in the editor
- **When to enable**: Only when you need ChatGPT to perform editor operations
- **Warning**: Can affect editor state and project settings

#### üîí Allow File I/O Operations (DANGEROUS)
- **Default**: OFF
- **Risk**: Can read and write files on your system
- **When to enable**: Only when you need ChatGPT to work with external files
- **Warning**: Can lead to data loss or file corruption

**Important**: Each permission requires explicit confirmation when enabled. You will see a warning dialog explaining the risks.

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Store your API key in environment variables
- Keep your API key confidential and never commit it to version control
- Regenerate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised
- Use separate API keys for development and production

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Hard-code API keys in source files
- Share API keys in public repositories
- Use the same API key across multiple projects without access controls

### Permission Management

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Keep all permissions disabled unless actively needed
- Review ChatGPT's proposed actions before enabling permissions
- Disable permissions immediately after use
- Maintain regular backups before enabling destructive permissions
- Test in a separate project first
- Review the audit log regularly to track asset operations

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Enable all permissions by default
- Leave permissions enabled when not in use
- Use on production projects without thorough testing
- Trust AI-generated code without review
- Ignore confirmation dialogs - always review what will be created/modified

### Asset Automation Security

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Always review the confirmation dialog before proceeding with asset operations
- Check the audit log after operations to verify what was changed
- Keep backups of your project before using asset automation
- Test asset commands in a test project first
- Understand what each command will do before confirming

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Blindly confirm asset operations without reading the preview
- Use asset automation on production assets without testing
- Delete the audit log - it's your record of what changed
- Ignore failed operations - check the audit log for details

### General Security

- **Review all AI-generated code** before running it in your project
- **Use version control** (Git) to track all changes
- **Test in isolated environments** before applying changes to production projects
- **Monitor API usage** to detect unusual activity
- **Keep the plugin updated** to receive security patches

## Troubleshooting

### "Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable"

- Ensure you've set the environment variable correctly
- Restart Unreal Editor after setting the variable
- Verify the variable is set: `echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%` (Windows) or `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY%` (macOS/Linux)

### "Failed to connect to OpenAI API"

- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check OpenAI service status at [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com)
- Ensure your firewall isn't blocking HTTPS requests

### API Error (HTTP 401)

- Your API key is invalid or has been revoked
- Regenerate your API key from the OpenAI dashboard

### API Error (HTTP 429)

- You've exceeded your API rate limit or quota
- Check your OpenAI account usage and billing settings

### Asset Operation Failed

- Ensure "Allow Asset Write Operations" permission is enabled
- Check that the asset name is valid (no special characters)
- Verify the target path exists (e.g., /Game/Materials)
- Review the audit log at `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log` for details
- Make sure you confirmed the operation in the dialog

### Asset Not Found for Rename/Delete

- Ensure the asset name exactly matches an existing asset
- Check the Content Browser for the correct asset name
- Try using the full package path instead of just the name

### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working

- Ensure the ChatGPT window has focus
- On some systems, modifier keys may differ (try Cmd instead of Ctrl on macOS)
- Check that no other plugins are intercepting the same shortcuts

## Accessibility

The ChatGPTEditor plugin is designed with accessibility in mind:

### Visual Accessibility
- **Adjustable Text Size**: Font sizes from 8pt to 24pt accommodate different visual needs
- **High Contrast**: Uses Unreal Editor's standard styling for consistent contrast
- **Visual Icons**: Emoji and symbols provide visual cues (üîí for security, ‚è≥ for loading, etc.)
- **Clear Layout**: Well-organized interface with clear visual hierarchy

### Keyboard Accessibility
- **Full Keyboard Navigation**: All functions accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- **Tab Navigation**: Standard tab key navigation between UI elements
- **No Mouse Required**: Can send messages, clear history, and adjust settings without mouse

### Cognitive Accessibility
- **Tooltips**: Every interactive element has descriptive tooltip text
- **Consistent Layout**: Interface elements stay in predictable locations
- **Clear Labels**: All buttons and controls are clearly labeled
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for ongoing operations

### Best Practices for Accessible Use
1. Adjust font size to your comfort level using Ctrl+/- or the accessibility buttons
2. Hover over any element to see its tooltip description
3. Use keyboard shortcuts for faster workflow without mouse dependency
4. Enable only the permissions you need for clear security status

## Known Limitations

- **Blueprint creation is conceptual**: The current implementation shows how Blueprint generation would work with preview and approval, but actual Blueprint node creation requires deeper integration with Blueprint editor APIs
- **No local AI support**: Requires internet connection and OpenAI API access
- **Conversation context**: Limited by API token limits (approximately 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **No streaming responses**: Responses arrive all at once rather than streaming
- **Blueprint explanation is AI-based**: Explanations are generated by AI based on Blueprint names, not actual Blueprint analysis
- **Asset automation requires specific command formats**: Commands must follow the documented patterns (e.g., "Create material X")
- **No local AI support**: Requires internet connection and OpenAI API access
- **Conversation context**: Limited by API token limits (approximately 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **No streaming responses**: Responses arrive all at once rather than streaming
- **Asset operations create basic assets**: Created assets have default settings and may need manual configuration

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Full Blueprint node creation using Blueprint editor APIs
- Visual Blueprint selection for explanation (instead of name-based)
- Streaming response support
- Custom system prompts
- Conversation save/load functionality
- Advanced Blueprint refactoring suggestions
- Multi-model support (GPT-4, etc.)
