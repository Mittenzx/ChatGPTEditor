4. **Check the log**: All command executions are logged to `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log`

#### Example Console Command Requests

```
User: "Execute the console command `stat fps`"
Assistant: [Detects command and prompts for confirmation]

User: "Show me the current screen percentage"
Assistant: [May suggest the command `r.screenpercentage`]

User: "Run `viewmode unlit`"
Assistant: [Extracts and executes the command with confirmation]
```

#### Safe Commands

These commands are considered safe and execute without additional warnings:
- `stat fps`, `stat unit`, `stat game`, `stat scenerendering`
- `showflag`, `viewmode`
- `r.screenpercentage`, `t.maxfps`
- `help`, `ke *` (key bindings)

#### Blacklisted Commands

The following commands are never allowed for security:
- `exit`, `quit`
- `crashdebug`, `debug crash`
- `obj delete`, `deleteall`, `destroyall`

### Python Scripting

The plugin can generate and execute Python scripts to automate Editor tasks. This feature requires the **Allow Console Commands** permission and the Python Editor Script Plugin to be enabled.

#### Prerequisites for Python Scripting

1. **Enable Python Editor Script Plugin**:
   - Go to Edit ‚Üí Plugins
   - Search for "Python Editor Script Plugin"
   - Enable it and restart the editor

2. **Enable the permission**: Check "Allow Python Scripting" in the ChatGPT window

#### How to Use Python Scripting

1. **Request a script**: Ask ChatGPT to write a Python script for your task
   - Example: "Write a Python script to list all actors in the current level"
   - Example: "Generate a script to automate asset organization"
2. **Preview the script**: The script will be shown in a preview dialog
3. **Review warnings**: Any potentially dangerous operations will be flagged
4. **Confirm execution**: Approve the script to execute it
5. **Check results**: Script output appears in the Output Log
6. **Check the audit log**: All executions are logged to `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log`

#### Example Python Script Requests

```
User: "Write a Python script to list all actors in the level"
Assistant: [Generates Python script with unreal module imports]
System: [Shows preview and security warnings]
User: [Confirms execution]
System: [Executes script and shows results]
```

```
User: "Generate a script to automate creating folders in the Content Browser"
Assistant: [Generates script using unreal.EditorAssetLibrary]
System: [Warns about asset modification operations]
User: [Reviews and confirms]
```

#### Script Security

The plugin validates scripts for potentially dangerous operations:
- File system access (`os`, `sys`, `subprocess`)
- Code execution functions (`exec`, `eval`, `compile`)
- Destructive operations (`delete`, `remove`, `destroy`)

You'll be warned about these operations before execution.

### Audit Logging

All console commands and Python scripts are logged for security and debugging purposes.

**Log Location**: `[ProjectRoot]/Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log`

**Log Format**:
```
[2025-10-26 15:30:45] CONSOLE_COMMAND: stat fps | Success: YES
[2025-10-26 15:31:12] PYTHON_SCRIPT: import unreal; unreal.log("Hello") | Success: YES
[2025-10-26 15:32:05] CONSOLE_COMMAND: dangerous_command | Success: NO | Error: User declined confirmation
```

**What's Logged**:
- Timestamp of execution
- Type of operation (CONSOLE_COMMAND or PYTHON_SCRIPT)
- The command or script content (truncated for long scripts)
- Success/failure status
- Error messages (if applicable)

### Project File and Config Management

With the **File I/O Operations** permission enabled, you can use natural language to read and modify project configuration files.

#### Reading Files

Simply ask ChatGPT to read a file:
```
"Read the DefaultEngine.ini file"
"Show me the contents of Config/DefaultGame.ini"
"What's in my .uproject file?"
```

ChatGPT will use the `READ_FILE:` command internally to fetch the file contents and display them in the conversation.

#### Modifying Files

Ask ChatGPT to make specific changes to configuration files:
```
"Set the default game mode to MyGameMode in DefaultEngine.ini"
"Add a new plugin dependency to the .uproject file"
"Change the max FPS to 120 in DefaultEngine.ini"
```

When ChatGPT generates a file modification:
1. A **preview dialog** will appear showing the exact changes
2. You must **explicitly confirm** before any changes are applied
3. A **backup** is automatically created (with timestamp) before writing
4. All operations are **logged** to `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log`

#### Safety Features

- **Path Validation**: Only files within your project directory can be accessed
- **Preview Required**: All changes must be previewed and confirmed
- **Automatic Backups**: Original files are backed up before modification
- **Audit Logging**: Every file operation is logged with timestamp
- **Permission Required**: File I/O permission must be explicitly enabled

#### Supported File Types

- Configuration files (`.ini`): DefaultEngine.ini, DefaultGame.ini, etc.
- Project files (`.uproject`)
- Any text-based project configuration files

#### Example Workflow

1. **Enable File I/O Permission**: Check the "Allow File I/O Operations" checkbox and confirm the warning
2. **Ask ChatGPT**: "I need to enable ray tracing in DefaultEngine.ini"
3. **Review Changes**: ChatGPT will show you the proposed changes in a preview dialog
4. **Confirm**: Click "Yes" to apply the changes or "No" to cancel
5. **Verify**: Check the audit log at `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log` for the operation record

### Documentation and Code Review Features

The plugin now supports advanced documentation and code review capabilities:

#### Code Explanation

Ask ChatGPT to explain code, classes, or project structure using natural language:

**Examples:**
- "Explain this class" (when discussing a specific class in conversation)
- "Summarize the plugin architecture"
- "What does the SChatGPTWindow class do?"
- "Review the security implementation"
- "How does the audit logging work?"

These requests are automatically logged in the audit trail but don't modify any files.

#### Documentation Generation

Request ChatGPT to generate or update documentation files:

**Examples:**
- "Generate a README for this feature"
- "Update the documentation with the new features"
- "Create API documentation"
- "Write a usage guide"

**Important:** 
- Documentation operations require the **File I/O Operations** permission to be enabled
- All proposed changes are **previewed** before being applied
- You must **explicitly confirm** each file modification
- Only documentation files (.md, .txt, .rst, .adoc) can be modified
- All operations are restricted to the plugin directory for security

#### Audit Log

Click the **"View Audit Log"** button to see a complete history of:

### Documentation Features

The plugin includes a documentation generation and code review system:

- **AuditLog**: Thread-safe logging system that tracks all operations
- **DocumentationHandler**: Manages documentation file operations with security restrictions
  - Safe file path validation (plugin directory only)
  - Allowed file types: .md, .txt, .rst, .adoc
  - Path traversal protection
  - Preview generation
  - File read/write with error handling
- **Integration**: Automatically detects documentation requests and provides preview/confirmation workflow

## Troubleshooting

### "Please set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable"

- Ensure you've set the environment variable correctly
- Restart Unreal Editor after setting the variable
- Verify the variable is set: `echo %OPENAI_API_KEY%` (Windows) or `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY%` (macOS/Linux)

### "Failed to connect to OpenAI API"

- Check your internet connection
- Verify your API key is valid
- Check OpenAI service status at [status.openai.com](https://status.openai.com)
- Ensure your firewall isn't blocking HTTPS requests

### API Error (HTTP 401)

- Your API key is invalid or has been revoked
- Regenerate your API key from the OpenAI dashboard

### API Error (HTTP 429)

- You've exceeded your API rate limit or quota
- Check your OpenAI account usage and billing settings

### Test Generation Issues

If test generation isn't working or producing poor results:

- **Use specific prompts**: Instead of "test my code", try "Write a unit test for a function that validates asset names"
- **Specify the test type**: Make sure you've selected the appropriate test type (Unit/Integration/Functional)
- **Check security warnings**: If code is rejected, review the warnings and adjust your request
- **Review audit log**: Check `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log` for detailed error messages

## Test Automation Examples

### Example 1: Basic Unit Test

**Prompt**: "Write a unit test that validates FString concatenation"

**Test Type**: Unit Test

**Result**: Generates a simple automation test that verifies string operations work correctly.

### Example 2: Asset Validation Test

**Prompt**: "Create a test that checks if asset names follow naming conventions (prefix with T_ for textures)"

**Test Type**: Functional Test

**Result**: Generates a test that iterates through assets and validates their naming.

### Example 3: Blueprint Integration Test

**Prompt**: "Write an integration test that verifies a Blueprint can be loaded and its default values are correct"

**Test Type**: Integration Test

**Result**: Generates a test that loads a Blueprint asset and validates its properties.

### Writing Effective Test Prompts

For best results, include:
- **What to test**: The specific functionality or component
- **Expected behavior**: What should happen in the test
- **Test scope**: Unit, integration, or functional level
- **Any constraints**: Platform-specific, performance requirements, etc.

**Good prompt example**:
```
Write a unit test for a custom Actor component that manages health.
The test should verify:
- Initial health is set correctly
- TakeDamage reduces health
- Health never goes below zero
- OnHealthChanged delegate fires when health changes
```

**Poor prompt example**:
```
test health
```

## Known Limitations

- **Test execution integration**: Currently, tests must be manually copied to your project and run via Unreal's Test Automation window. Direct execution from the ChatGPT window is not yet implemented.
- **No local AI support**: Requires internet connection and OpenAI API access
- **Conversation context**: Limited by API token limits (approximately 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **No streaming responses**: Responses arrive all at once rather than streaming
- **Code review required**: All generated test code must be manually reviewed for correctness and security
### Console Command Not Executing

- Ensure "Allow Console Commands" permission is enabled
- Check that the command is not blacklisted
- Verify the command syntax is correct for Unreal Engine
- Check the audit log at `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log` for error details

### Python Script Not Executing

- Verify the "Python Editor Script Plugin" is enabled (Edit ‚Üí Plugins)
- Ensure "Allow Console Commands" permission is enabled
- Restart the editor after enabling the Python plugin
- Check the Output Log for Python execution errors
- Review the audit log at `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log`

## Known Limitations

- **File I/O limited to project files**: Only files within the project directory can be accessed for security
- **Asset Write operations**: UI toggle present but not yet implemented
- **Console Commands**: UI toggle present but not yet implemented
- **Python dependency**: Python scripting requires the Python Editor Script Plugin to be enabled
- **No local AI support**: Requires internet connection and OpenAI API access
- **Conversation context**: Limited by API token limits (approximately 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **No streaming responses**: Responses arrive all at once rather than streaming
- **Command parsing**: Natural language command extraction may not work for all phrasings
### Scene Editing Not Working

- Ensure you have enabled the "Allow Scene Editing" permission
- Make sure you have an active level open in the editor
- Check that your command follows the supported syntax (see Usage section)
- Review the audit log for error details

### "No active world found"

- This error appears when no level is open in the editor
- Open or create a level before using scene editing commands

## Known Limitations

- **Scene editing command parsing**: Currently supports predefined patterns (see Usage section for examples)
- **No local AI support**: Requires internet connection and OpenAI API access
- **Conversation context**: Limited by API token limits (approximately 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **No streaming responses**: Responses arrive all at once rather than streaming
- **Actor type detection**: Limited to common actor types (lights, cameras, static meshes, triggers)
### Asset Operation Failed

- Ensure "Allow Asset Write Operations" permission is enabled
- Check that the asset name is valid (no special characters)
- Verify the target path exists (e.g., /Game/Materials)
- Review the audit log at `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log` for details
- Make sure you confirmed the operation in the dialog

### Asset Not Found for Rename/Delete

- Ensure the asset name exactly matches an existing asset
- Check the Content Browser for the correct asset name
- Try using the full package path instead of just the name

### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working

- Ensure the ChatGPT window has focus
- On some systems, modifier keys may differ (try Cmd instead of Ctrl on macOS)
- Check that no other plugins are intercepting the same shortcuts

## Accessibility

The ChatGPTEditor plugin is designed with accessibility in mind:

### Visual Accessibility
- **Adjustable Text Size**: Font sizes from 8pt to 24pt accommodate different visual needs
- **High Contrast**: Uses Unreal Editor's standard styling for consistent contrast
- **Visual Icons**: Emoji and symbols provide visual cues (üîí for security, ‚è≥ for loading, etc.)
- **Clear Layout**: Well-organized interface with clear visual hierarchy

### Keyboard Accessibility
- **Full Keyboard Navigation**: All functions accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- **Tab Navigation**: Standard tab key navigation between UI elements
- **No Mouse Required**: Can send messages, clear history, and adjust settings without mouse

### Cognitive Accessibility
- **Tooltips**: Every interactive element has descriptive tooltip text
- **Consistent Layout**: Interface elements stay in predictable locations
- **Clear Labels**: All buttons and controls are clearly labeled
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for ongoing operations

### Best Practices for Accessible Use
1. Adjust font size to your comfort level using Ctrl+/- or the accessibility buttons
2. Hover over any element to see its tooltip description
3. Use keyboard shortcuts for faster workflow without mouse dependency
4. Enable only the permissions you need for clear security status

## Known Limitations

- **Documentation parsing is basic**: The system uses pattern matching to detect documentation requests. Complex requests may not be automatically detected.
- **No local AI support**: Requires internet connection and OpenAI API access
- **Conversation context**: Limited by API token limits (approximately 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **No streaming responses**: Responses arrive all at once rather than streaming
- **File operations limited**: Only documentation files (.md, .txt, .rst, .adoc) in the plugin directory can be modified
- **Manual content extraction**: For documentation generation, you may need to manually extract and format the AI's response
- **Blueprint creation is conceptual**: The current implementation shows how Blueprint generation would work with preview and approval, but actual Blueprint node creation requires deeper integration with Blueprint editor APIs
- **No local AI support**: Requires internet connection and OpenAI API access
- **Conversation context**: Limited by API token limits (approximately 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **No streaming responses**: Responses arrive all at once rather than streaming
- **Blueprint explanation is AI-based**: Explanations are generated by AI based on Blueprint names, not actual Blueprint analysis
- **Asset automation requires specific command formats**: Commands must follow the documented patterns (e.g., "Create material X")
- **No local AI support**: Requires internet connection and OpenAI API access
- **Conversation context**: Limited by API token limits (approximately 4096 tokens for GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **No streaming responses**: Responses arrive all at once rather than streaming
- **Asset operations create basic assets**: Created assets have default settings and may need manual configuration
