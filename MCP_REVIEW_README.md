## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What is MCP?
**A:** Model Context Protocol - an open standard for connecting AI models to tools and data using JSON-RPC 2.0.

### Q: Why should we adopt it?
**A:** 
- 40-50% less code
- Works with any AI model (not just OpenAI)
- Industry standard
- Better architecture
- Easier to test and maintain

### Q: How long will it take?
**A:** 4-6 months for full implementation, with phased approach allowing incremental value.

### Q: What are the risks?
**A:** Low to medium. Main risks are learning curve and migration effort, both mitigated through phased approach and POC validation.

### Q: What if it doesn't work out?
**A:** Phase 1 is a 2-3 week POC with clear go/no-go decision point. Low risk investment before full commitment.

### Q: Will it break existing features?
**A:** No. Migration approach maintains backward compatibility. Users won't notice changes.

### Q: Can we use both old and new approaches?
**A:** Yes. Hybrid approach during transition allows gradual migration and comparison.

### Q: What AI models will it support?
**A:** Any MCP-compatible model: Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, local LLMs (Llama, etc.)
