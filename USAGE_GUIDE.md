### Blueprint Generation Not Working

- Ensure "Allow Asset Write Operations" is enabled
- Check that you approved the warning dialog
- Verify the Blueprint prompt is clear and specific
- Review the conversation history for error messages

### Asset Automation Not Detecting Commands

- Make sure ChatGPT's response contains explicit commands like "Create material X"
- Enable "Allow Asset Write Operations" permission
- Check the conversation history for "Detected X asset operation(s)" message
- Try rephrasing your request to be more explicit

### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working

- Ensure the ChatGPT window has focus (click on it first)
- On macOS, try Cmd instead of Ctrl
- Check that other plugins aren't intercepting the shortcuts

- Try clicking directly on the font size display to reset

### Audit Log Not Exporting

- Ensure you have write permissions to the target directory
- Try exporting to a different location (e.g., Desktop)
- Check the Unreal Editor output log for error messages
- Verify operations have been performed (log is only created when there are entries)

### Permission Toggle Not Working

- Click the checkbox itself, not just the label
- Read the warning dialog completely before dismissing
- If stuck enabled, restart the editor to reset to default (OFF)
