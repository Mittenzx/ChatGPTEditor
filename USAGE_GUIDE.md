2. Go to **Window ‚Üí ChatGPT** in the menu bar
3. The ChatGPT window will open as a dockable tab
4. You can dock it anywhere in your editor layout

### First-Time Setup

Before using the plugin, ensure you have:
- Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your API key
- Restarted Unreal Editor after setting the environment variable
- Verified the API key is set correctly

## Basic ChatGPT Conversation

### Sending Messages

1. Type your question or request in the input box at the bottom
2. Click "Send" or press **Ctrl+Enter**
3. Wait for the response to appear in the conversation history
4. Continue the conversation - the plugin maintains context

### Clearing History

- Click the "Clear" button to start a new conversation
- Or press **Ctrl+L** to clear via keyboard shortcut
- This removes all messages and resets the conversation context

### Example Conversations

**General Questions:**
```
You: "How do I create a character controller in Unreal Engine?"
Assistant: [Provides detailed explanation]
```

**Code Help:**
```
You: "Show me how to spawn an actor at runtime in C++"
Assistant: [Provides code examples]
```

## Blueprint Scripting Assistant

The Blueprint Scripting Assistant helps you generate and understand Blueprints using natural language.

### Generating Blueprints

**Requirements:**
- Enable "Allow Asset Write Operations" permission toggle
- Accept the security warning when enabling

**Steps:**
1. Enable the "Allow Asset Write Operations" checkbox
2. In the "Blueprint Scripting Assistant" section, enter your Blueprint description
   - Example: "Create a health pickup that restores 25 health points"
3. Click "Generate Blueprint"
4. Review the preview dialog showing:
   - Your original request
   - Generated Blueprint description
   - List of nodes to be created
   - Connections between nodes
   - Security warning
5. Click "Approve & Create" to generate, or "Reject" to cancel
6. Check the conversation history for confirmation

**Example Prompts:**
- "Create a damage zone that hurts the player when they enter it"
- "Make a collectible coin that disappears when picked up"
- "Build a door that opens when the player presses E"

### Explaining Blueprints

**Steps:**
1. In the Blueprint name field, enter the name of a Blueprint
   - Example: "BP_PlayerController"
2. Click "Explain Blueprint"
3. View the explanation in the conversation history with:
   - Summary of the Blueprint's purpose
   - Step-by-step breakdown of its logic

**Note:** Currently provides AI-generated explanations based on Blueprint names. Future versions will support visual selection and actual Blueprint analysis.

### Blueprint Audit Log

**Viewing Operations:**
- All Blueprint generation and explanation requests are logged
- Includes timestamps, user prompts, AI responses, and approval decisions

**Exporting Logs:**
1. Click "Export Audit Log" in the Blueprint Scripting Assistant section
2. Choose a save location
3. Review the exported text file for compliance and security review

## Asset Automation

Asset Automation allows you to create and manage Unreal Engine assets using natural language commands.

### Supported Commands

**Creating Assets:**
- `Create material MaterialName` - Creates a new material
- `Create texture TextureName` - Creates a new texture
- `Create blueprint BlueprintName` - Creates a new blueprint

**Managing Assets:**
- `Rename OldName to NewName` - Renames an asset
- `Move AssetName to /Game/NewPath` - Moves an asset
- `Delete AssetName` - Deletes an asset (requires extra confirmation)

### Using Asset Automation

**Setup:**
1. Enable "Allow Asset Write Operations" permission
2. Accept the security warning

**Workflow:**
1. Ask ChatGPT to create or modify assets using natural language
   - Example: "Create a material called M_GlowingMetal and a texture called T_MetalBase"
2. ChatGPT will respond with the appropriate commands
3. The system detects asset operations in the response
4. For each operation:
   - A confirmation dialog appears showing what will be created/modified
   - Review the details carefully
   - Click "OK" to proceed or "Cancel" to skip
5. Check the conversation history for operation results

**Example Conversation:**
```
You: "I need materials for my game - M_Metal, M_Wood, and M_Stone"
Assistant: "I'll help you create those materials. Create material M_Metal. Create material M_Wood. Create material M_Stone."
System: Detected 3 asset operation(s) in response.
System: Processing: Create Material - M_Metal
[Confirmation Dialog] ‚Üí User approves
System: ‚úì Successfully executed: Create Material
[Process repeats for M_Wood and M_Stone]
```

### Asset Audit Log

All asset operations are logged to `Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log` with:
- Timestamp
- Operation type
- Asset name
- User name
- Success/failure status
- Additional details

**Viewing the Log:**
- Navigate to `YourProject/Saved/ChatGPTEditor/audit.log`

## Tips and Best Practices

### General Usage

1. **Start with simple questions** to test the connection
2. **Provide context** in your prompts for better responses
3. **Use clear, specific language** when requesting asset operations
4. **Keep conversations focused** on one topic for better context

### Blueprint Scripting

1. **Always review the preview** before approving Blueprint generation
2. **Start with simple Blueprints** to understand the workflow
3. **Test generated Blueprints** in a separate project first
4. **Export audit logs regularly** for compliance records

### Asset Automation

1. **Enable permissions only when needed** and disable immediately after
2. **Review confirmation dialogs carefully** before proceeding
3. **Use descriptive asset names** (e.g., M_MetalChrome not Mat1)
4. **Check the audit log** after operations to verify success
5. **Keep backups** before using asset automation on production projects

### Security

1. **Never enable all permissions by default**
2. **Read warning dialogs** before clicking OK
3. **Review audit logs** periodically for unusual activity
4. **Test new features** in non-production projects
5. **Keep the plugin updated** for security patches

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Window Not Opening

- Check that the plugin is enabled in Edit ‚Üí Plugins
- Restart Unreal Editor after enabling
- Look for the ChatGPT menu item under Window

### API Connection Failed

- Verify OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set
- Restart Unreal Editor after setting the variable
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key is valid at platform.openai.com

### Blueprint Generation Not Working

- Ensure "Allow Asset Write Operations" is enabled
- Check that you approved the warning dialog
- Verify the Blueprint prompt is clear and specific
- Review the conversation history for error messages

### Asset Automation Not Detecting Commands

- Make sure ChatGPT's response contains explicit commands like "Create material X"
- Enable "Allow Asset Write Operations" permission
- Check the conversation history for "Detected X asset operation(s)" message
- Try rephrasing your request to be more explicit

### Keyboard Shortcuts Not Working

- Ensure the ChatGPT window has focus (click on it first)
- On macOS, try Cmd instead of Ctrl
- Check that other plugins aren't intercepting the shortcuts
- Restart the editor if shortcuts stop responding

### Font Size Not Changing

- Use the A-/A+ buttons if keyboard shortcuts don't work
- Check that the conversation history box is visible
- Try clicking directly on the font size display to reset

### Audit Log Not Exporting

- Ensure you have write permissions to the target directory
- Try exporting to a different location (e.g., Desktop)
- Check the Unreal Editor output log for error messages
- Verify operations have been performed (log is only created when there are entries)

### Permission Toggle Not Working

- Click the checkbox itself, not just the label
- Read the warning dialog completely before dismissing
- If stuck enabled, restart the editor to reset to default (OFF)

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Features

You can use multiple features together:
1. Ask ChatGPT for advice on Blueprint design
2. Use the advice to craft a Blueprint generation prompt
3. Generate the Blueprint with approval
4. Create supporting assets using Asset Automation

2. Generate blueprints for interactive elements
3. Create materials and textures via asset automation
4. Review audit logs at end of session

**Documentation Workflow:**
1. Use Blueprint Explanation for existing Blueprints
2. Copy explanations to design documents
3. Export audit log showing all analyzed Blueprints
